**When I first got injured, I thought my life was over.**  
They gave me a wheelchair and sent me home. No instructions. No guidance. No roadmap. Just a new reality I had to figure out on my own.  

How do you get out of bed? How do you take a shower? How do you **rebuild** when everything feels like itâ€™s gone?  

I had no idea what I was doing, but I refused to stay stuck.  

ðŸ’¡ **What helped?**  
- **Other guys who had been through it.** The ones who knew the hacks, the struggles, and what actually worked.  
- **Seeing proof that life wasnâ€™t over.** That people in my situation could drive, work, travel, and live like men again.  
- **Learning to fight for my own independence.** No one was going to hand it to me.  

### ðŸ›  **Now, I want to hear from YOU.**  
- What was the hardest thing to figure out after your injury?  
- What advice would you give someone whoâ€™s just starting out?  
- Whatâ€™s one thing that gave you hope when you thought you had none?  

Drop a comment or DM me. Letâ€™s start this conversation. No one should have to figure this out alone.
